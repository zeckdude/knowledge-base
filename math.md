#### Quick Reference Notes

| Term | Definition | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real number $\mathbb{R}$ | Any number that is either a rational or irrational number  | $-6, -\tfrac{7}{2}, 0, \tfrac{3}{4}, \sqrt{2}, \pi, 12$ |
| Rational number $\mathbb{Q}$ | Any number that is either an integer or a fraction  | $-6, -\tfrac{7}{2}, 0, \tfrac{3}{4}, \tfrac{11}{6}, 12$ |
| Irrational number $\mathbb{R-Q}$ | Any number that can not be written as a fraction  | $\sqrt{2}, \pi$ |
| Whole number $\mathbb{W}$ | Any number that is either 0 or a positive number  | $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...$ |
| Natural number (counting number) $\mathbb{N}$ | Any number that is a positive number (not including `0`)  | $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...$ |
| Integer $\mathbb{Z}$ | Any number, not including fractions, that is either a negative number, `0`, or positive number  | $..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$ |
| Set Notation | A way of writing what values are included in a set | $\mathbb{W} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\}$ or $\text{Family = \{Father, Mother, Sister, Brother\}}$|
| Identity number | A number that doesn't change the "identity" of the original value | The identity number for addition is 0 and for multiplication is 1 |
| Signed number | A positive or negative number | *None* |
| Absolute value | The distance a number is from 0 on the number line | Absolute values are always positive numbers. It is indicated by wrapping a number by the pipe character, such as `\|-3\|` |
