2. Limit number of requests
  - Host own fonts
3. Size of files
  - Minify CSS
  - 

DOCTYPE tells the browser which version of HTML the site is using so the website loads properly.

Which CSS selectors win
- Specificity
- Importance (!important keyword)
- Source order (later styles of the same specificity and importance win)

px vs em vs rem
- px: Actual pixels
- em: Multiplier based on the font-size of the parent element
- rem: Multiplier based on the font-size on the html element

Arguments vs parameter
- arguments: values passed to a function
- parameters: values available inside a function as defined variables
